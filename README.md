# MinesweeperJava
Minesweeper program written as part of JetBrains Academy Java track

## About
Program a minesweeper game that'll work with multidimensional arrays. We'll also deal with algorithms for generating the playfield
and processing player moves. Also, we will work with collections and stacks.

#### Stage 1
Simply output to console a minefield with `X` as mines and `.` as safe spots.

#### Stage 2
Since it's no fun knowing where all the mines are in the game, we'll generate a new random configuration eveytime we play.

We'll let the player choose how many mines they wish to play with by inputting a number from the keyboard.

After asking the player, generate a new field and display it. The mines are still visible at this stage, and should be on a
9x9 size field.
